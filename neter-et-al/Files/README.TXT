
Description of Data Files


     This IBM-compatible diskette contains 216 data set files in
ASCII format for the two textbooks:

          Neter, J., Kutner, M. H., Nachtsheim, C. J., and
          Wasserman, W., Applied Linear Regression Models, 3rd
          Edition, Richard D. Irwin, Inc., Burr Ridge, Illinois,
          1996.

and:

          Neter, J., Kutner, M. H., Nachtsheim, C. J., and
          Wasserman, W., Applied Linear Statistical Models, 4th
          Edition, Richard D. Irwin, Inc., Burr Ridge, Illinois,
          1996.

     This diskette includes the data sets for all text examples, the
data sets for the problems, exercises, and projects at the ends
of chapters, and the data sets in Appendices C and D.  The data
in a data set are arranged in columns that are separated by
spaces.  The ordering of the columns (variables) can be readily
ascertained from the tabular display of the data set in the text
since the text always provides the data for at least the initial
and final cases.

     Data sets have names in one of the following formats depending
on whether the data pertain to a problem, table, figure, or an
appendix (xx or x denotes the number):

        CHxxPRxx     For data sets from end-of-chapter problems,
                     exercises, and projects.

                     Example:  CH04PR12 denotes the data set for
                               Problem 4.12 in Chapter 4.

        CHxxTAxx     For data sets from text tables.

                     Example:  CH17TA02 denotes the data set for
                               Table 17.2 in Chapter 17.

        CHxxFIxx     For data sets from text figures.

                     Example:  CH32FI11 denotes the data set for
                               Figure 32.11 in Chapter 32.

        APCx         For data sets from Appendix C.

                     Example:  APC1 denotes the data set in
                               Appendix C.1.

        APDPRxx      For data sets from problems in Appendix D.

                     Example:  APDPR10 denotes the data set for
                               Problem D.10 in Appendix D.

All file names are followed by the extension .DAT to identify that the
file contains data.
